Litteraly all you need to do is just get the GMS version and you're done. thats it.

you can use lastest steam version of GMS2 if you want DONT BE SUPPRISED FOR BUGS TOUGH AS TRUST ME I TRYED IT, ALOT OF IT IS FUCKED.



if someone makes it to where it supports latest steam build of GMS2 we could maybe have an xbox port or even playstation port of pizza tower guys hear me out- (i wont do that but like still i have no idea what im doing so it whuld be mutch of an effort.)



credits go to femloy for open tower and they have all rights to take this repository down. i dont support piracy at all but like, if im attempting to make it to where people dont have to figure out the steamworks things at this point like no.



the only thing you need to have is a beefy pc, otherwise feel free to do whatever, no need to credit me for the steamworks fixed version i have here. I just made this mainly because of some people are just lazy or dont know what they're doing and dont want to watch a how to guide plus who the fuck cares about steam achevements right?



again all credits go to femloy for the opentower project. its optional if you credit me for using this version of the decomp.



again it is perfered you get this version of GMS2, you can use the lastest steam build if you want but again expect alot of bugs.
